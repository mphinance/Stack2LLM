<p>Disclaimer: I’m just a guy who likes numbers and cooking meat, not a financial advisor. Do your own DD or don’t blame me.</p><p>Remember when <span class="cashtag-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;symbol&quot;:&quot;$FIGR&quot;}" data-component-name="CashtagToDOM"></span>  IPO’d back in September at $25 and immediately popped to $36? Yeah, we all watched that rocket. But unlike most of the garbage IPOs we’ve seen lately that pump and dump into oblivion, Figure Technology Solutions seems to have found a home.</p><p>I’ve been watching the charts you see attached, and my favorite thing is happening: <strong>Boring Consolidation.</strong></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KReR!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F96b1254f-f3d4-4f20-bb5c-4576cfdc389f_1029x756.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KReR!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F96b1254f-f3d4-4f20-bb5c-4576cfdc389f_1029x756.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KReR!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F96b1254f-f3d4-4f20-bb5c-4576cfdc389f_1029x756.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KReR!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F96b1254f-f3d4-4f20-bb5c-4576cfdc389f_1029x756.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KReR!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F96b1254f-f3d4-4f20-bb5c-4576cfdc389f_1029x756.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/96b1254f-f3d4-4f20-bb5c-4576cfdc389f_1029x756.png" width="1029" height="756" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/96b1254f-f3d4-4f20-bb5c-4576cfdc389f_1029x756.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:756,&quot;width&quot;:1029,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;TradingView chart&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="TradingView chart" title="TradingView chart" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KReR!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F96b1254f-f3d4-4f20-bb5c-4576cfdc389f_1029x756.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KReR!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F96b1254f-f3d4-4f20-bb5c-4576cfdc389f_1029x756.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KReR!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F96b1254f-f3d4-4f20-bb5c-4576cfdc389f_1029x756.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KReR!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F96b1254f-f3d4-4f20-bb5c-4576cfdc389f_1029x756.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Created with <a href="https://tradingview.com">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure></div><p></p><p>Take a look at the daily. We are sitting right at $35.27. It kissed $35, looked around, and decided it liked the view. The Bollinger Bands are squeezing tighter than my wallet after a Costco run, which usually means a move is coming. But more importantly for us Theta Gang members, it means we have a floor to play with.</p><p>Here is the trade plan for the week/month, followed by why I actually kinda like this company (and why I’m terrified of it).</p><h2>THE TRADE PLAN: WHEELING THE BLOCKCHAIN 🛞</h2><p>I’m looking at $35 as the line in the sand.</p><p><strong>Cash Secured Puts (The “Safe” Play)</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Strike:</strong> $35 (At The Money) or $30 (Conservative)</p></li><li><p><strong>Why:</strong> If the support at $35 holds (which it has been respecting since the IPO dust settled), you keep the premium. If it drops and you get assigned at $35? You own a profitable fintech company at its support level.</p></li><li><p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Sell the monthly puts. The IV isn’t insane like $NVDA or $TSLA, but it’s decent enough to pay for your weekend steak. If you get assigned, turn around and sell the $35 or $40 Covered Calls. Rinse. Repeat. Free shares.</p></li></ul><p><strong>The “Degenerate” Upside Play</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Strategy:</strong> If you believe the Bull case below, grab some May ‘26 LEAPS at the $40 strike.</p></li><li><p><strong>Why:</strong> If this breaks out of the current wedge, $45 is the next stop.</p></li></ul><h2>THE BULL CASE: REAL REVENUE?! 🐂</h2><p>Unlike 99% of the “Blockchain” companies we talk about that are just vibes and vaporware, Figure actually... makes money?</p><ul><li><p><strong>Profitable:</strong> They posted net income of $90M recently. In this market? That’s a unicorn.</p></li><li><p><strong>Real Product:</strong> They aren’t selling monkey JPEGs. They are doing HELOCs (Home Equity Lines of Credit) on the Provenance Blockchain. They cut the approval time from 45 days to like 5 days.</p></li><li><p><strong>Efficiency:</strong> By putting loans on the blockchain, they cut out the middlemen (title companies, lazy bankers). Less friction = higher margins.</p></li><li><p>**<strong>The Captain: Mike Cagney’s Resume</strong><br>You aren’t just betting on blockchain tech; you’re betting on a guy who already built a multi-billion dollar fintech business: SoFi. Cagney co-founded and was the CEO of SoFi, which revolutionized student lending before expanding into a full digital bank. He knows how to scale a disruptive lending operation from zero to massive scale. His vision for Figure is essentially “SoFi, but fully on the blockchain.” This proven ability to execute in the financial sector is the kind of leadership institutional money loves.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Chart:</strong> Look at that daily candle setup. It’s refusing to break down below the IPO opening range. That shows institutional support.</p></li></ul><h2>THE BEAR CASE: THE LOCKUP LOOMS 🐻</h2><p>It can’t all be sunshine and rainbows.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Interest Rates:</strong> Their entire business is HELOCs. If rates stay high or go higher, people stop borrowing against their houses.</p></li><li><p><strong>Lockup Expiration:</strong> The IPO was Sept 10, 2025. The 180-day lockup expires around <strong>March 2026</strong>. That means insiders (employees, early investors) might flood the market with shares in a few months.</p></li><li><p><strong>Competition:</strong> Traditional banks are slow, but they are big. If Chase or Wells Fargo decides to actually upgrade their tech (unlikely, but possible), Figure loses its edge.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Verdict:</strong><br>I’m selling the $35 Puts. I want the premium, and I don’t mind owning it here if I have to.</p><p>MPH</p><div class="community-chat" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://open.substack.com/pub/mphinance/chat?utm_source=chat_embed&quot;,&quot;subdomain&quot;:&quot;mphinance&quot;,&quot;pub&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:6464018,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Momentum Phinance&quot;,&quot;author_name&quot;:&quot;mphinance&quot;,&quot;author_photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uoW2!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fadc027e4-2ad9-45cf-8f74-7ced0e708891_1080x1920.png&quot;}}" data-component-name="CommunityChatRenderPlaceholder"></div><p></p>
