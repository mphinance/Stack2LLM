<p>The Richest Man in Babylon is a book, with words, on pages. It's got what are called the 7 Cures For A Lean Purse, but they're a bit outdated. Here's my version, with a little Buffett sprinkled in so you not as smart ones feel smarter.</p><p></p><p>**1. The Book: "Start thy purse to fattening."**</p><p>My Version:  PAY YOURSELF FIRST.</p><p></p><p>*"Do not save what is left after spending, but spend what is left after saving."*</p><p></p><p>Before your landlord gets a dime, before you buy a coffee, before you pay for that streaming service you don't even use. Your brokerage account gets its cut. Automate it. Shove it in an index fund. The rest of your bills can fight for the scraps. Your future self will thank you. Your present self can suck it up. This is the entire and only useful part of Rich Dad, Poor Dad. Just saved you another reading - you're welcome!</p><p></p><p>**2. The Book: "Control thy expenditures."**</p><p>My Version: STOP BUYING DUMB SHIT.</p><p></p><p>*"If you buy things you do not need, soon you will have to sell things you need."*</p><p></p><p>Seriously. You don't need the new iPhone. You don't need $300 shoes. You don't need a $90k truck to drive to your office job. Every dollar you pss away on depreciating crap is a dollar that could be compounding into a "fck you" number. Make a budget? Nah. Just stop being a consumer f*cktard.</p><p></p><p>**3. The Book: "Make thy gold multiply."**</p><p>My Version: LET YOUR MONEY BABIES MAKE MONEY BABIES.</p><p></p><p>This is compounding, the 9th wonder if the world. My name literally means " He Who Is Like The Lord." If you ask me what the 8th is, you haven't been listening. Anyway. This is the game. You buy wonderful companies at fair prices, not $PEW - and you let it RIDE. Let time do the heavy lifting. This is how you get rich while you sleep.</p><p></p><p>**4. The Book: "Guard thy treasures from loss."**</p><p>My Version: BUFFETT'S RULE #1. DON'T. LOSE. MONEY.</p><p></p><p>This is the one most  ignore. They loaded long, 100% in, with no downside protection. No condoms. Hope you can pull out on time. </p><p></p><p>Buy the hedge. Get some $VIX calls. Have some cash. Don't "invest" in sh*t you don't understand. Don't get greedy. Protect your goddamn stack.</p><p></p><p>**5. The Book: "Make of thy dwelling a profitable investment."**</p><p>My Version: DON'T BE HOUSE-POOR.</p><p></p><p>This one's debatable, and new generations will find this increasingly difficult. The book says own your home. I say, if your mortgage and insurance and taxes are strangling you so you can't invest... you fucked up. A house is a liability that *might* appreciate - and ask @TRON if they always sell. If you can house-hack, fine. But don't expect your 3-bed, 2-bath in the suburbs to be your ticket to freedom. That's what your portfolio is for.</p><p></p><p>**6. The Book: "Insure a future income."**</p><p>My Version: PLAN FOR WHEN YOU'RE OLD AND YOUR D*CK DOESN'T WORK.</p><p></p><p>This is the boring shit. The "just in case" fund. This is for when you're 70 and can't time a $BTC quadruple top to save your life. Max the IRA, max the 401k. It’s boring, but it's the backstop so you don't have to be a greeter at $WMT. It's what allowed my father, and at a much younger age, our own @Rise to become a millionaires.</p><p></p><p>**7. The Book: "Increase thy ability to earn."**</p><p>My Version: STOP SITTING ON YOUR ASS </p><p></p><p>Old Tommy Jefferson said something like, "It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing." You think you get rich watching Netflix? You think your money multiplies while you're binging TikTok? No.</p><p></p><p>Your brain, your hands...they're for doing shit. Learn a skill. Build a side hustle. Read a 10-K. If you're awake, you should be building. Wealth doesn't happen by accident, it's built by not being a lazy ass. </p>
