<p>I've elected not to import all my old posts from a previous platform, but did decide to allow myself to repost two of my favorites - this is the first.</p><div><hr></div><p>I was recently introduced to <strong>Best Loser Wins</strong> by Tom Hougaard (thank you @Locker) It claims to be a book on trading, disguised as psychology. As I was reading I found myself nodding - not because I have mastered anything in the market, but because I’d already survived something far more cunning: myself. This post is selfishly mostly for my own self reflection, and has zero financial advice, so I’ll just say this was a great, rather, a phenomenal book.</p><p>Every line about discipline, fear, and sitting while the world tilts? I’ve heard that sermon before. Not from a broker in a suit, but from the ragged edge of addiction, and the slow, stubborn climb of recovery. Jelly Roll’s music can make you feel this far better than I can ever explain.</p><p>Anyway, turns out, when you’ve learned how to lose everything and still show up the next day - you already know the secret. You’ve just been calling survival, rather than strategy, up until now.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EFju!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55123af9-b365-4276-a913-e70925875b0c_1024x608.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EFju!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55123af9-b365-4276-a913-e70925875b0c_1024x608.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EFju!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55123af9-b365-4276-a913-e70925875b0c_1024x608.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EFju!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55123af9-b365-4276-a913-e70925875b0c_1024x608.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EFju!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55123af9-b365-4276-a913-e70925875b0c_1024x608.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/55123af9-b365-4276-a913-e70925875b0c_1024x608.png" width="1024" height="608" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/55123af9-b365-4276-a913-e70925875b0c_1024x608.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;normal&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:608,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EFju!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55123af9-b365-4276-a913-e70925875b0c_1024x608.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EFju!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55123af9-b365-4276-a913-e70925875b0c_1024x608.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EFju!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55123af9-b365-4276-a913-e70925875b0c_1024x608.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EFju!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55123af9-b365-4276-a913-e70925875b0c_1024x608.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">A surreal, gritty photograph taken over the shoulder of a man sitting at a complex trading desk in a dark room. His weathered hands rest on the desk, illuminated by the harsh glow of multiple monitors. On the screens, the financial charts are not flat; they rise up three-dimensionally, morphing into a rugged, jagged mountain range made of glowing red and green data that a tiny, lone silhouette figure is actively climbing amidst digital storm clouds. The intense light from these screens casts complex, interwoven patterns of glowing biological data streams onto the man's hands and arms, symbolizing internal rewiring. A worn recovery medallion sits subtly on the desk near the keyboard. The mood is tense, cinematic, and resilient.</figcaption></figure></div><p></p><p><strong>ADDICTION AND RECOVERY TAUGHT ME TO BE THE BEST LOSER</strong></p><p>1. Emotional Regulation<br>In recovery, I learned to sit with some deeply uncomfortable feelings—cravings, guilt, boredom, raw fear—and not immediately self-destruct in response.<br>Now, when I’m trading and the chart turns red, I use the same skill. I stay calm. I don’t flinch or chase. I just breathe and follow my plan.</p><p>2. Discipline &amp; Routine<br>Recovery wasn’t about big breakthroughs—it was about showing up every day, especially when I didn’t want to.<br>Trading works the same way. I don’t chase highs. I follow structure. I trust the process, even when it’s boring.</p><p>3. Self-Awareness<br>Addiction forced me to get brutally honest. I started spotting the lies I told myself—“just one more,” “I’m fine.”<br>Turns out, traders lie to themselves too. “This trade will turn around.” “I’ll just double down.”<br>Recovery gave me the superpower to call out my own BS.</p><p>4. Tolerance for Discomfort<br>Most people chase comfort like it’s a birthright. I’ve learned that comfort can be a trap.<br>Recovery taught me how to stay put in discomfort—how to hold its hand and keep walking anyway.</p><p>5. Letting Go of Control (perhaps should be #1)<br>Recovery taught you that control is a myth. You can’t control the world—only your response to it.<br>Same in trading. I can’t control the market, but I can manage my risk. That’s not weakness. That’s wisdom hard-earned.</p><p>I am the biggest loser I know, and today I can be grateful for it. My greatest enemy is cunning, baffling, &amp; powerful, and has beaten me more times than I can count. But every time I’ve lose, I’ve learned. Every time I’ve hit the floor... it was usually slower, but I did stand up stronger.</p><p>Fall. Lose. Adapt. <strong>Then WIN.</strong><br></p>
