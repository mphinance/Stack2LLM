<p>I write about selling options for income often (or if you’re new to following me - it’s what you’ll see a lot of), and if done correctly on good stocks, can be as good or even more profitable than straight growth. However, after going trader full-time, I became obsessed with income to pay bills. I spent the last year learning that <strong>Yield</strong> without <strong>Growth</strong> is a trap, and <strong>Growth</strong> without <strong>Income</strong> is stressful. Attempting to have one without the other just doesn’t work.</p><p>This illustration is on a grander scale, and hopefully will make my financial advisor friend and colleague TerrifiedOfAI a little proud.</p><p></p><blockquote><p><strong>“Yield</strong> without <strong>Growth</strong> is a trap, and <strong>Growth</strong> without <strong>Income</strong> is stressful”</p></blockquote><p></p><p>For this here experiment, we’re going to race the every popular <span class="cashtag-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;symbol&quot;:&quot;$SPY&quot;}" data-component-name="CashtagToDOM"></span> and <span class="cashtag-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;symbol&quot;:&quot;$QQQ&quot;}" data-component-name="CashtagToDOM"></span> against <span class="cashtag-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;symbol&quot;:&quot;$TSPY&quot;}" data-component-name="CashtagToDOM"></span>, <span class="cashtag-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;symbol&quot;:&quot;$SPYI&quot;}" data-component-name="CashtagToDOM"></span>, <span class="cashtag-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;symbol&quot;:&quot;$JEPQ&quot;}" data-component-name="CashtagToDOM"></span>, and <span class="cashtag-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;symbol&quot;:&quot;$QQQI&quot;}" data-component-name="CashtagToDOM"></span>. I didn’t even bother with <span class="cashtag-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;symbol&quot;:&quot;$JEPI&quot;}" data-component-name="CashtagToDOM"></span> in this comparison because it wasn’t in the same ballpark.</p><p>For brevity’s sake, I’m not going to go into what each of these funds do in this post. Check the Googs, I’m sure it can tell ya.</p><h2>Performance and Return Summary: Growth Still Wins the Race</h2><p>Over the 15-month span from August 2024 to December 2025, <strong>QQQ</strong> delivered a commanding 27.23% Total Real Return. Let’s be clear: growth still wins, especially when the market is running. This number is the highest on the scoreboard and serves as the benchmark we must all strive to approach.</p><p></p><div id="datawrapper-iframe" class="datawrapper-wrap outer" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/7fVpj/1/&quot;,&quot;thumbnail_url&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f20d7fa6-16d5-4e44-b850-3191f98201e4_1220x536.png&quot;,&quot;thumbnail_url_full&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/907de0a4-4c9f-45c0-9dc4-05ab2f6c0980_1220x660.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:349,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Growth &amp; Income Trade-Off Analysis&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;An analysis of SPY and QQQ and various income funds&quot;}" data-component-name="DatawrapperToDOM"><iframe id="iframe-datawrapper" class="datawrapper-iframe" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/7fVpj/1/" width="730" height="349" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script></div><p></p><p>However, the income funds delivered a surprisingly strong challenge. The Nasdaq-focused enhanced-yield fund <strong>QQQI</strong> captured 25.08%, with <strong>JEPQ</strong> securing the third spot overall at 22.45%. This is significant because it confirms that you <em>can</em> generate substantial monthly cash flow without abandoning all upside potential, but the final, pure growth number from QQQ still stands apart.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 family followed a similar, albeit tighter, pattern. <strong>SPY</strong> logged 20.59%, while the two S&amp;P income plays, <strong>TSPY</strong> and <strong>SPYI</strong>, trailed slightly at 17.95% and 17.89%, respectively. They provided the essential yield, but their total return profile was a couple of steps behind the QQQ group. The Year-to-Date (YTD) returns confirm this hierarchy, with QQQ leading at 18.06%, QQQI at 14.92%, and SPY at 13.40%.</p><p>Edit: forgot to share this: <a href="https://totalrealreturns.com/s/TSPY,JEPQ,QQQI,SPYI,SPY,QQQ">Total Real Returns Link</a></p><h2>Drawdown and Volatility Analysis: The Necessary Trade-off</h2><p>Here is the inevitable, necessary trade-off for chasing that top-line growth number: <em>risk</em>. The data shows this explicitly in the drawdown metrics. The pure growth fund, <strong>QQQ</strong>, suffered the most brutal peak-to-trough drawdown of any fund in the study at -23.54%. You pay for the outperformance with serious volatility exposure.</p><p>Conversely, the funds that deliberately sacrifice some upside delivered stability. <strong>SPYI</strong> proved its shock absorption capabilities by limiting its worst drawdown to just -16.85%, with <strong>TSPY</strong> close behind at -18.43%. This confirms the option strategies applied to the S&amp;P 500 base are highly effective for volatility containment.</p><p>The current market sentiment, as of December 2, 2025, further emphasizes this point: <strong>JEPQ</strong> was back at a 0% current drawdown, having fully recovered its recent turbulence. Meanwhile, QQQ was still carrying the largest current drawdown at -2.44%.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RPDa!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb0d818e-08d6-4eb6-a6ca-48213d0881d0_1024x608.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RPDa!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb0d818e-08d6-4eb6-a6ca-48213d0881d0_1024x608.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RPDa!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb0d818e-08d6-4eb6-a6ca-48213d0881d0_1024x608.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RPDa!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb0d818e-08d6-4eb6-a6ca-48213d0881d0_1024x608.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RPDa!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb0d818e-08d6-4eb6-a6ca-48213d0881d0_1024x608.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/db0d818e-08d6-4eb6-a6ca-48213d0881d0_1024x608.png" width="552" height="327.75" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/db0d818e-08d6-4eb6-a6ca-48213d0881d0_1024x608.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;normal&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:608,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:552,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RPDa!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb0d818e-08d6-4eb6-a6ca-48213d0881d0_1024x608.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RPDa!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb0d818e-08d6-4eb6-a6ca-48213d0881d0_1024x608.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RPDa!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb0d818e-08d6-4eb6-a6ca-48213d0881d0_1024x608.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RPDa!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb0d818e-08d6-4eb6-a6ca-48213d0881d0_1024x608.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><h3>Income Winner: Why NEOS (SPYI, QQQI) Deserves the Crown</h3><p>While JEPQ performed admirably, the real income winner here is the NEOS suite. <strong>SPYI</strong> achieved the lowest maximum drawdown of the entire enhanced-yield group (-16.85%) while still generating competitive returns. Crucially, NEOS’s use of index options offers superior tax treatment (Section 1256 contracts) on the options side of their income stream, a massive advantage that pure performance numbers don’t capture. Frankly, this level of tax-efficient income generation and drawdown control is why the older generation, like <strong>JEPI</strong> and its peers, no longer merit a detailed comparison in this category—the innovation is simply elsewhere.</p><p>The data is conclusive. While income strategies are essential for risk mitigation and providing dependable cash flow for those already married to a financial plan, the ultimate prize in total real return belongs to growth. The pursuit of pure growth, while volatile, simply prints a higher number over time.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>This is the first time I believe I’ve asked this Wikipedia Pop-Up we’re all familiar with, and I promise I won’t do it often:</strong></p><p><em>I publish everything publicly because I want it to be accessible.
