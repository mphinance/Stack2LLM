<p>Money and happiness.&nbsp;</p><p>The first $500k I made throughout my career was mostly the hard way. Part of why I saved the max 401k and did max Roth contributions though were so there would be something of me left when I died - I had no intention of using it myself. There are days working through recovery where this is still real.</p><p>I knew if the money wasn’t on my paycheck I wouldn’t spend it on the things I was trying to slowly kill myself with. I never had the courage to do it the way Marshawn did, thank higher power, but I tried every other way. There was no light, only despair - I just didn’t want to feel it when I went.&nbsp;</p><p>I won’t say I ever *wanted* to die necessarily - I simply didn’t see a point to be being alive. I was a drag on society, I was hurting my parents, my brothers, alienating my best friends… for the love of a bottle. Ultimately I chose those things in place of real love as well, including that of myself. My biggest advantage also became my biggest disadvantage - I was smart enough and have never been so proud to not recognize what I was becoming…what I already was; there was no denial.&nbsp;</p><p>I just didn’t give a shit.&nbsp;“I’d rather be a good liver than have one!”,&nbsp;“only quitters quit drinkin’”, and&nbsp;“I’m not an alcoholic, they go to meetings!” became my knee slappers. Didn’t realize I was the only one laughing.</p><p>I’m not gonna be completely depressing here, but these are serious, real world examples of money not being able to buy happiness. Between using friends, jails, and just associating with the wrong people… I’ve held more dying people than I ever care to admit or ever wish upon someone. I was 14 when my first friend died in my arms after we got thrown out the back windshield from our 16 year old drunk drivers’ accident. Didn’t even phase me from stopping at the time.</p><p>So let’s break this up with a hint for the ladies or if you’re a man with a man at home - the only Christmas present every single man in the world wants. Head in the morning, then take the kids if you got em, and GTFO. Do whatever you want, but let him know you won’t be back until 5 with pizza. No texts or calls all day. Whether he sits at home or goes fishing or has a bourbon or masturbates to the thought of you finally giving him head for the first time in years - you don’t ask. No money outta pocket. You’re welcome.</p><p>Back to real shit - YOU ARE NOT ALONE. No one here is. I don’t care if you lurk or if you reply to every one of my posts, I love every fucking one of you that has bothered to read this far. Readers interacting is what makes the game of money I play, fun.&nbsp;</p><p>Just make sure you’re making money for the right reasons, is all I’m trying to say, I think.&nbsp;If you think that number in your account is going to fix what’s broken inside, or make you happy... man.</p><p>Other than y’all, to me this is a giant expensive game. It’s fun. It’s a challenge to figure out the puzzle, and frankly I’m just happier about being right on a gut feeling more than I do about the money. Bitcoin, for example - even $10k was a dream to me ten years ago when I found that beautiful decentralized piece of fake internet money. Watching the financial world finally changing for the better though… it’s a feeling a can’t describe. When the AI boom started&nbsp; and I started reading this crazy @TRON guys’ posts about $PLTR on $RDDT I knew I found the best of the AI companies. $AVGO and $CLS were too easy. I know I’ve found the best Datacenter + Bitcoin companies in $GLXY, even if you haven’t seen it yet. I don’t really care about the stock price though - that’s just a happy side effect of being right.</p><p>(If you or someone you know is in crisis, call or text 988 in the US and Canada. In the UK, you can call 111.)</p><p>On a lighter note, since I mentioned this being a “game,” it got me thinking. What kind of player are you?&nbsp;</p><p>RTS (Age of Empires, Myth, StarCraft): You’re a macro trader. You love resource management, seeing the whole map, and planning 10 steps ahead. You’ve got 5 positions moving at once and you know exactly what they’re all doing.&nbsp;</p><p>Puzzle / Math Games (Tetris, Sudoku):&nbsp;Quant and technical analysis. Pattern recognition and logic. You see the setup before it happens and love the clean, rule-based systems.</p><p>FPS (Call of Duty, Counter-Strike): Scalp it! 0DTEs and futures are your jam - tick charts and 1 minute candles. Pure reaction time, hotkeys, lightning-fast reflexes, and high-stress, high-reward entries and exits.</p><p>RPGs (World of Warcraft, Skyrim): Seen the movie Grinders? The long-term investor. You love the research (lore/DD), you’ve got patience for days, and you’re all about compounding small wins over time to level up your port.</p><p>Poker / Magic: The Gathering: You’re the options seller (the casino). You’re not playing the stock; you’re playing the other players (market sentiment). It’s all about probability, risk management, and knowing when to fold ‘em.</p><p>Just a thought. Keep it fun, because if you don’t, darkness can creep in.</p>
