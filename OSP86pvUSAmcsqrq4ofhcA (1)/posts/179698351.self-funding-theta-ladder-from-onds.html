<p>I just want to give a disclaimer...I do love $ONDS, but mostly because people I trust, and my son, do. I suck at flying drones though I do love photography. Yes I think and know they've got huge parts to play moving forward. I'm comfortable doing all of this at 6.50 as well. I am no @TRON or @Drone_Daddy though in this sector - I simply skate to where the 🏒 is going.</p><p></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!a7nn!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34650e1d-0989-4e4a-86fc-0965b91376ee_1005x1311.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!a7nn!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34650e1d-0989-4e4a-86fc-0965b91376ee_1005x1311.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!a7nn!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34650e1d-0989-4e4a-86fc-0965b91376ee_1005x1311.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!a7nn!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34650e1d-0989-4e4a-86fc-0965b91376ee_1005x1311.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!a7nn!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34650e1d-0989-4e4a-86fc-0965b91376ee_1005x1311.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/34650e1d-0989-4e4a-86fc-0965b91376ee_1005x1311.png" width="1005" height="1311" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/34650e1d-0989-4e4a-86fc-0965b91376ee_1005x1311.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;normal&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:1311,&quot;width&quot;:1005,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1895894,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!a7nn!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34650e1d-0989-4e4a-86fc-0965b91376ee_1005x1311.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!a7nn!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34650e1d-0989-4e4a-86fc-0965b91376ee_1005x1311.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!a7nn!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34650e1d-0989-4e4a-86fc-0965b91376ee_1005x1311.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!a7nn!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34650e1d-0989-4e4a-86fc-0965b91376ee_1005x1311.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p></p><p>Warfare is always brought up, but to give something more positive - search and rescue is going to be amazing. Medical/organ delivery to a moving vehicle (air or ground ambulance). Your damn $AMZN. Forgotten medication at home. </p><p></p><p>I love $UBER and think they've got an awesome future. I also believe a lot of the places they're branching into - short distance package delivery, grocery delivery...</p><p></p><p>It's the easiest way to automate all this. Think even court summons, serving divorce papers, bringing your kids' lunch still sitting on the counter to school, your backup set of keys, fucking order fire starters to the woods using Starlink internet. The first true robot in every home won't look like Sonny, it'll be a small flying toy helicopter.</p><p></p><p>Drones are already being used to Detect, Surveille, etc for search and rescue, but it won't be long before they're saving our firemen grabbing your 🐈 from the burning litterbox, or delivering fresh water and a life jacket (or even protection) to a downed pilot before help arrives. </p><p></p><p>I'm getting into $JOBY and $ACHR territory when discussing moving humans - but the time is coming. Maybe it's $RCAT or maybe all of them. There will definitely be challenges - most off then regulatory but there are definitely uphill battles.</p><p></p><p>The nerdy kids that can either fly the drones (regulate and direct the games, don't completely discourage them), or code the automations they'll need to be safe and reliable, or learning to repair them here on the ground - thems the rich kids of tomorrow. </p><p></p><p>AI will have a large part in the first two as well. If I were the military wanting to train the flying in dangerous situations, I'd already be feeding it recordings of the best E-sports pilots, and secretly host a lot more with prizes to increase the sample size. Kids rock. Cute little guinea.</p><p></p><p>Hopefully this helps explain what really goes through the noggin... Consider this "showing my work". Wanna guess what my son*also* hates doing, though he may be a little more... Sheldon, than I ever was, about it? Probably shouldn't have let him watch that.</p><p>------</p><p><strong>THE TRADE</strong></p><p>You’ve been following me for a while. You’ve seen the posts on $RXRX, $RIVN, and $ACHR. You’ve seen the premiums. But you’ve never actually taken the plunge on wheeling, have you?</p><p></p><p>Maybe you're scared of assignment. Maybe you're worried about the stock dropping to zero while you're holding the bag.</p><p></p><p>Well, grab your floaties, because we’re going into the deep end, but this time I’m making the market pay for your life jacket.</p><p></p><p>This is a low-risk, high-IQ way to enter a position that I call the Self-Funding Theta Ladder. It’s basically crowdfunding your own insurance policy using the premiums from the degenerates buying weeklies.</p><p></p><p>Here is the logic that happens in my head in seconds, slowed down for you week-by-week. Basic assumption will have to be made that Monday opens close to Friday closes (i.e. these numbers don't drastically change before Friday).</p><p></p><p><strong>THE SETUP: "THE WASH" (Monday / Day 0)</strong></p><p>I want to sell puts for income, but I want protection through December. Usually, protection costs money. Not today.</p><p></p><p>- BUY: 1x Dec 19 $6 Put (The Shield). Cost: $55.</p><p>- SELL: 1x Nov 28 $6 Put (Week 1 Income). Credit: $17.</p><p>- SELL: 1x Dec 05 $6 Put (Week 2 Income). Credit: $35.</p><p></p><p>The Math:</p><p></p><p>I spend $55 on insurance. I collect $52 from the two short puts.</p><p>Net Cost: $3.00. Basically free. 🧼</p><p>I am now short two contracts and long one. Let the games begin.</p><p></p><p><strong>WEEK 1: MONDAY, DEC 1 (Post-Thanksgiving)</strong></p><p></p><p>The Nov 28 put has expired. Now we execute the logic.</p><p></p><p><strong>IF $ONDS is &gt; $6 (The Happy Path):</strong></p><p></p><p>- Status: The Nov 28 put expired worthless. I kept the $17.</p><p>- The Move: I reload the ladder. I sell the Dec 12 $6 Put.</p><p>- Assumption: Price/IV is similar to today's Dec 05 pricing. Let's be conservative and use the current Dec 12 board price of $0.26.</p><p></p><p>The P&amp;L:</p><p></p><p>- Total Credits: $17 (Week 1) + $35 (Week 2 pending) + $26 (Week 3 new) = $78.</p><p>- Total Debit: $55 (The Shield).</p><p>- Net: I am UP +$23, and I still hold the Dec 19 protective put for free.</p><p></p><p><strong>ELSE ($ONDS is &lt; $6) (The Wheel Path):</strong></p><p></p><p>- Status: I was assigned 100 shares at $6.</p><p>The Shield: My Dec 19 Long Put is now worth more than $55 because the stock dropped. It's protecting my share value.</p><p>- The Move: I turn around and sell a Covered Call on my new shares.</p><p>- Note: I am still short the Dec 05 put (see next week).</p><p></p><p><strong>WEEK 2: MONDAY, DEC 8</strong></p><p></p><p>The Dec 05 put has expired. We check the chart.</p><p></p><p><strong>IF $ONDS is &gt; $6 (The "Infinite Money" Glitch):</strong></p><p></p><p>- Status: The Dec 05 put expired worthless. I kept the $35.</p><p>- The P&amp;L: My insurance is fully paid for. Every dollar I make from here is pure profit.</p><p>- The Move: I sell the Dec 19 $6 Put (turning my long put into a vertical spread to cap profit) OR I roll the ladder to Dec 26.</p><p>- Result: I am collecting rent on a house I didn't even have to buy.</p><p></p><p><strong>ELSE ($ONDS is &lt; $6) (The Double Down Defense):</strong></p><p></p><p>Scenario A (I was assigned in Week 1):</p><p></p><p>I already have 100 shares. Now I get assigned another 100 shares from the Dec 05 put.</p><p></p><p>- The Move: I exercise my Dec 19 Long Put to sell those 100 new shares back at $6.</p><p>- Net Result: I deleted the second assignment risk. I’m back to 100 shares, but I kept all the premiums.</p><p></p><p>Scenario B (It tanked just this week):</p><p></p><p>Nov 28 expired worthless (stock was &gt;$6 then).</p><p>Stock dropped &lt;$6 now.</p><p></p><p>- Result: Assigned 100 shares.</p><p>- The Move: Sell Covered Calls. Keep the Dec 19 Long Put as catastrophe insurance in case it goes to $4 next week.</p><p></p><p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p><p>Stop being scared of the wheel.</p><p></p><p>By laddering these puts (selling the front weeks to pay for the back week), you are entering a trade where:</p><p></p><p>- Upside: You generate income ($17, $35, $26...) without using your own capital for the hedge.</p><p>- Downside: You have a pre-paid parachute (Dec 19 Put) if the floor falls out.</p><p></p><p>You're basically telling Mr. Market: "Pay me to hold this safety net."</p><p></p><p>----</p><p></p><p>💡 Other Real Science (Non)Fiction</p><p><strong>THE INVISIBLE INFRASTRUCTURE PLAY</strong></p><p></p><p>Everyone is looking at the birds, but nobody is looking at the nests. If we're going to have a sky full of buzzing delivery boys, they can’t all come home to charge every 20 minutes. </p><p></p><p>We’re going to need "gas stations" in the sky. I’m talking automated docking stations on top of every cell tower, skyscraper, and maybe even streetlights.</p><p></p><p>Companies that can nail the autonomous charging and data offloading infrastructure (think $AMT or even legacy utilities adapting) are going to be the silent winners here. </p><p></p><p>Plus, don't sleep on the data. A drone delivering your pizza is also mapping the neighborhood, checking power lines for heat signatures, and spotting potholes for the city. The data that thing collects on a 5-minute flight might end up being worth more than the pepperoni pie it’s carrying. Who is processing that? $PLTR? $GOOGL? The hardware is cool, but the data is the gold mine.</p>
