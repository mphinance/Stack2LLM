<p>For years, I was a master of the mask.</p><p>If you look at my professional history, you see the highlights. You see the high-end white-collar roles, the cool job titles, and the “crushing it” persona of a successful professional. To the muggles, I had it all.</p><p>Inside, I was bankrupt.</p><p>I was a high-functioning addict. I was a man who could manage complex projects and large data by day while losing his soul to his dependencies by night. I was miserable, terrified, and utterly alone in a room full of people.</p><p>Today, I am writing this because I am no longer that man. I am a person in long-term recovery.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VYGT!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb1dc54e0-b3a5-4de2-aa4d-babcb2d94443_2816x1536.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VYGT!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb1dc54e0-b3a5-4de2-aa4d-babcb2d94443_2816x1536.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VYGT!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb1dc54e0-b3a5-4de2-aa4d-babcb2d94443_2816x1536.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VYGT!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb1dc54e0-b3a5-4de2-aa4d-babcb2d94443_2816x1536.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VYGT!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb1dc54e0-b3a5-4de2-aa4d-babcb2d94443_2816x1536.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b1dc54e0-b3a5-4de2-aa4d-babcb2d94443_2816x1536.png" width="1456" height="794" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b1dc54e0-b3a5-4de2-aa4d-babcb2d94443_2816x1536.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:794,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:5630232,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://mphinance.substack.com/i/183662406?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb1dc54e0-b3a5-4de2-aa4d-babcb2d94443_2816x1536.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VYGT!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb1dc54e0-b3a5-4de2-aa4d-babcb2d94443_2816x1536.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VYGT!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb1dc54e0-b3a5-4de2-aa4d-babcb2d94443_2816x1536.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VYGT!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb1dc54e0-b3a5-4de2-aa4d-babcb2d94443_2816x1536.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VYGT!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb1dc54e0-b3a5-4de2-aa4d-babcb2d94443_2816x1536.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>I decided to walk away from the corporate machine not just because I wanted to trade stocks, but because I needed to save my life. I had to trade the prestige and the accompanying misery for a life of “Traders Serenity” and radical honesty.</p><p>For a while, I tried to find my way back into that world. I looked for jobs. But between a shifting job market, the rise of AI, and my own colorful background, finding a traditional fit was difficult. Those doors remained closed for a reason.</p><p>Instead of fighting to get back into a system that was killing me, I realized I had already developed the skills to make money with the money I had. I stopped looking for a boss and started looking for a way to give back.</p><p>I’ve dedicated my life to teaching people how to do exactly what I do. People often ask why I haven’t rushed to get a Series 65 license to manage other people’s money. The answer is simple. I would much rather teach you how to fish than fish for you.</p><p>A lot of people think recovery is about what you lose. They think it is a story of “less than.”</p><p>For me, recovery is my edge. It is my operating system.</p><p>In the trading world, people talk about risk management, psychology, and ego. Most traders fail because they cannot handle the truth about themselves. They cannot admit when they are wrong. They cannot sit with discomfort. They double down on losing positions because their ego is tied to being “right.”</p><p>Recovery taught me how to kill my ego. It taught me that a loss is just a data point, not a verdict on my soul. It taught me the discipline of the “grinder.” Whether the market is green or red, I show up, I follow my rules, and I stay sober.</p><p>I stopped trying to be a “genius” and started being a student of the steps.</p><p>I am cross-posting this because the professional world is full of people wearing the same mask I used to wear. We are taught that vulnerability is a liability in business. We are told to keep our “personal issues” out of the boardroom.</p><p>That is a lie. My struggle was the very thing that made me a shell of a human being. My recovery is the very thing that makes me a successful trader, a present father, and a man who can finally look in the mirror without flinching.</p><p>To my fellow traders: The “Theta Gang” lifestyle isn’t just about selling options. It is about selling the volatility of your own life so you can live in the calm.</p><p>To my professional friends: If you are hiding behind a successful mask while drowning inside, you don’t have to do it anymore. The greatest trade I ever made was giving up the lie in exchange for the truth.</p><p>I’m Michael, and I’m mphinance. I’m a trader. I’m a grinder. And I am a grateful recovering addict.</p><p>The mask is officially off. Now, let’s get back to work.</p><p><em>If you want to read more about my transition from the corporate world to the trading desk, and the psychology behind it, you can follow my journey at<a href="https://mphinance.substack.com"> Momentum Phinance</a>.</em></p><p><em>Specifically, I wrote a piece about the intersection of wealth and mental health that might resonate:<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://mphinance.substack.com/p/money-happiness-and-this-fing-game"> </a><a href="https://mphinance.substack.com/p/addicted-to-losing">https://mphinance.substack.com/p/addicted-to-losing</a></em></p>
