<p>A friend of mine was talking about Thomas Jefferson earlier today, and it got me thinking about Jefferson’s letter to his nephew, Peter Carr. If you’re unfamiliar, Jefferson bestows a guide to life, education, and most famously - advice on questioning **everything**, including religion (very taboo at the time).</p><p>-------</p><p>You’re about to jump into the market. You’ll see my posts, you’ll see a thousand others. You’ll see screenshots of 500% gains, people calling the very top, and YOLOs that look like easy money. It all looks like a fast track to a new life.</p><p>It’s not.</p><p>So I’m writing you this one time with the only piece of advice that matters. It’s the same advice I give myself, and it’s the core of how I work: <strong>Do you own fucking research.</strong></p><p>Question, with boldness and extreme bias, even my best ideas. If my trade is truly good, it will stand up to your own analysis. If it doesn’t, it was never a good trade for <em>you</em>.</p><p>Don’t be a sheep. I post my ideas based on my own analysis, my own indicators, and my own experience. I’m just a guy on an app. I’m early, I’m late, I’m wrong. Following me or anyone else *blindly* is the fastest way to get your account blown to hell.</p><p>So how do you build that conviction?</p><p>Don’t just read the “news” or the “whale alerts.” That’s dogma. That’s just what someone <em>else</em> wants you to think. There is only one source that matters here, the primary one - the chart. The candles. The mother fucking MONEY, people, it’s the only language that matters.</p><p>Treat the chart as your scripture. Learn to read it like a book. Is it respecting the 8 EMA? Is it bouncing off the 50 SMA? Where is the <em>volume</em>? Is it real, or is it just algos playing games in premarket?</p><p>Look at the option chain for a good source of truth. Where is the open interest stacking up? Is the IV juiced to 190% before earnings? If it is, buying that call is a sucker’s bet. The “casino” (ME!) is selling that premium, and you should be, too. Learn what “theta” is and why it’s the most powerful force in the market.</p><p>The “wheel” that I post about a lot is not a lotto ticket - it’s a *<em>process*</em>; a strategy build on margin of safety and income. If you see me post a YOLO, you better believe that’s &lt;1% port allocation, not the whole damn thing. Most people just post the win (loss), not the position size. Yeah I lost money on $AIIO but has it made it so I can’t feed my kid?</p><p>Virtue in this game isn’t about being right 100% of the time. It’s about *<em>surviving*</em>. A good trader isn’t the one who never loses; it’s the one who knows exactly how much they *<em>can*</em> lose before they even enter the trade.</p><p>So, do your own DD. Trust the charts, not the hype. Build a process. Control your risk.</p><p>If you do that, you’ll be secure. Whether any single trade works out or not, you’ll still be in the game.</p><p>-MPH</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://mphinance.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://mphinance.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p>
