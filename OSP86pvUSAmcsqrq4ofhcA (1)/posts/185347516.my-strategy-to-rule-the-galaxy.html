(referring to my strategy to rule the galaxy - punny as ever).</strong></p><p>It’s hard to find existing posts about this since they just went public and aren’t listed on AfterHour yet, but I think we need to take a close look at <span class="cashtag-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;symbol&quot;:&quot;$GLXY&quot;}" data-component-name="CashtagToDOM"></span> . My recent selling of covered calls to free up cash may or may not have anything to do with this company that’s been public in Canada for a few years finally coming to NASDAQ.</p><p>Irresponsible things may be coming for a portion of my port. Ready for the flying arrows for saying this but thankfully <span class="cashtag-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;symbol&quot;:&quot;$MST&quot;}" data-component-name="CashtagToDOM"></span> R lovers are my friends too. “Strategy” is simply that right now -- a strategy. Stuff as much food in while there’s food to be stuffed, and figure out the rest later. Michael Novogratz is doing now what Mr. Sawyer’s “Strategy” involves, and most importantly, their share price will not be as tied to the actual price of Bitcoin as they will be able to continue making money:</p><blockquote><p><em>Trading began on the same day Galaxy disclosed that it is working with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to tokenize its shares. According to Bloomberg, the tokens representing Galaxy Digital’s shares could be used in decentralized finance applications, like borrowing or lending.</em></p></blockquote><p>Read again... it’s about damn time a company starts doing this seriously. Tokenizing shares of real assets, like a company (or now real estate is happening) was the first thing that came to my head when I first heard about blockchain technology. Add borrowing and lending, to, I don’t know, start making REVENUE! What a great... Strategy.</p><p>Now don’t get me wrong, I love Sawyer -- it’s the Sawyers, Karp, Buffett, Jenson... they make companies what they are. Michael Novogratz has been all in crypto since 2017. Failed investment company during the crypto crash. This likely turns people off. However, the ability to get the fuck back up and do it again, better and bigger and smarter than before -- that’s what he’s doing with Galaxy Digital (or I’m going to be a broke ass to be sure).</p><div><hr></div><h3>Fast Forward: The Validation</h3><p>THEN:</p><ul><li><p><em>“Companies that are also exploring or working on a US listing include Metaplanet, Circle, Kraken, and Gemini.”</em></p></li><li><p><em>“The company has secured a 15-year build-to-suit lease agreement with CoreWeave for a data center at Helios. This agreement is projected to generate approximately $9 billion in revenue over the contract’s duration, highlighting a significant growth opportunity for Galaxy Digital in the data center space.”</em></p></li><li><p><em>“For the second quarter, Galaxy Digital anticipates a positive operating income ranging from $160 million to $170 million.”</em></p></li></ul><p>NOW:</p><ol><li><p><strong>The Listing:</strong><br>The Nasdaq listing happened back in May ‘25. The liquidity floodgates opened exactly as expected.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Tokenization Prediction:</strong><br>The part I was most excited for in my original post. In September, Galaxy and Superstate officially launched tokenized $GLXY shares on Solana. They actually did it. They turned equity into collateral that can move at the speed of the blockchain rather than T+1 settlement speed. Praise Be.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Revenue Engine (<span class="cashtag-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;symbol&quot;:&quot;$CRWV&quot;}" data-component-name="CashtagToDOM"></span>):</strong><br>While everyone was arguing about $MSTR premiums relative to BTC NAV, Galaxy was quietly building an absolute fortress of recurring revenue with that CoreWeave deal. The pivot to High Performance Computing (HPC) for AI wasn’t just a buzzword; it was a lifeline that decoupled them from pure crypto price action.</p></li></ol><p>Novogratz didn’t just buy coins.
