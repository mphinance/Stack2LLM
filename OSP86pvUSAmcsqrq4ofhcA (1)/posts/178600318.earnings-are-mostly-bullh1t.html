<p>Thanks to @RallyVirtue817 for your question on how “accounting magic” can be done. Earnings a seriously mostly bullshit.  They’re a suggestion. A narrative. They’re the story a CFO wants to tell you, and they’ve got a million ways to write it.</p><p>You want the truth? Look at the top line. <strong>Revenue (Sales).</strong> That’s the only number that’s (mostly) real.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://mphinance.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Momentum Phinance is a reader-supported publication.

Let’s go ahead and ‘recognize’ it in Q2.” <em>Poof,</em> instant revenue beat.</p><p><strong>- Pushing Expenses Out:</strong> “You know all those bills we’re supposed to pay? Let’s just... not pay them ‘til next quarter.” Suddenly, cash flow looks amazing and expenses are down.</p><p>-</p><p><strong>- “Cookie Jar” Reserves:</strong> In a great quarter, they’ll squirrel away extra cash into a “reserve” for “future restructuring.” When a bad quarter comes, they just dip into the cookie jar to smooth out the numbers.</p><p><strong>- Changing Estimates:</strong> “That new multi-million dollar machine? It used to have a 5-year useful life for depreciation. Let’s change it to 10 years.” Just like that, the annual expense is cut in half, and net income goes up.</p><p><strong>💰 The Ultimate Money Glitch: EPS</strong></p><p>And don’t even get me started on my favorite f’ing money glitch: <strong>stock buybacks.</strong></p><p>A company’s <em>actual</em> Net Income (the “E” in EPS) can be flat as a board. But if they go spend a few billion buying back their own stock, the “S” (Shares) goes down.</p><p>What happens when you divide the same number by a smaller number? The result (EPS) looks bigger. It’s the ultimate “look over here!” financial engineering to make it seem like the company is growing when it’s just shrinking the denominator.</p><p><strong>👑 Why Sales is King</strong></p><p>This is why I look at <strong>Revenue (Sales)</strong> and the Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio first.</p><p>You can’t (easily) fake demand. You can’t “cost-cut” your way to higher revenue. It tells you if people are <em>actually</em> walking in the door and buying the damn boner pills or the AI chips. It’s the cleanest number you’ve got.</p><p>So stop letting CFOs play you. Look at the top line first. Sales growth is reality. Earnings are just the story they want you to believe.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://mphinance.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Momentum Phinance is a reader-supported publication.
