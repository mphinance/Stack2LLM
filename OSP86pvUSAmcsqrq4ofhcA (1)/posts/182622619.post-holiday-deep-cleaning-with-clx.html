<p>Looking at <strong>Clorox <span class="cashtag-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;symbol&quot;:&quot;$CLX&quot;}" data-component-name="CashtagToDOM"></span> </strong> right now is like staring at a giant red wine stain on a white carpet. You know the bleach can fix it, but you are also terrified you might accidentally dump the whole bottle and make things worse. The stock is currently trading at levels that would make even the most patient value investor reach for the smelling salts, , but this is my drill so I had to dig in a little.</p><p>Personal Verdict - I bought a few shares earlier this week to start watching as I don’t want to miss keeping my basis under $100 for the long term.  As always, this is not financial advice, this is my money so my rules to buy what I want, I just share the research.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ZB12!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3edf7a9b-7b79-4108-b049-336261ab2a5e_2816x1536.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ZB12!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3edf7a9b-7b79-4108-b049-336261ab2a5e_2816x1536.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ZB12!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3edf7a9b-7b79-4108-b049-336261ab2a5e_2816x1536.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ZB12!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3edf7a9b-7b79-4108-b049-336261ab2a5e_2816x1536.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ZB12!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3edf7a9b-7b79-4108-b049-336261ab2a5e_2816x1536.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3edf7a9b-7b79-4108-b049-336261ab2a5e_2816x1536.png" width="1456" height="794" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3edf7a9b-7b79-4108-b049-336261ab2a5e_2816x1536.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:794,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:6181089,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://mphinance.substack.com/i/182622619?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3edf7a9b-7b79-4108-b049-336261ab2a5e_2816x1536.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ZB12!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3edf7a9b-7b79-4108-b049-336261ab2a5e_2816x1536.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ZB12!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3edf7a9b-7b79-4108-b049-336261ab2a5e_2816x1536.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ZB12!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3edf7a9b-7b79-4108-b049-336261ab2a5e_2816x1536.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ZB12!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3edf7a9b-7b79-4108-b049-336261ab2a5e_2816x1536.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><div><hr></div><h2>The Recent Intel: ERP Hangovers and Market Share Battles</h2><p>The headline numbers from the November earnings report were a bit of a psychological gut punch. While Clorox actually beat earnings per share expectations at <strong>0.85</strong>, the <strong>19%</strong> revenue drop and <strong>17%</strong> organic sales decline sent the stock sliding toward its current 52-week low near <strong>98.00</strong>.</p><p>The culprit is the <strong>ERP</strong> (Enterprise Resource Planning) system transition. Earlier in the year, retailers loaded up on inventory as a buffer, and they are now drawing that inventory down. Management expects this “inventory reversal” to be a <strong>0.90</strong> headwind to EPS for the full fiscal year 2026. Most concerning, however, was CEO Linda Rendle’s admission that the transition caused them to lose more market share in August and September than they anticipated. They are now in a dogfight to win back shelf space from private label brands that flourished while Clorox was dealing with shipping hiccups.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://mphinance.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://mphinance.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>The Bear Case: Why the Stain Might Not Come Out</h2><p>We have to look at why the “smart money” is currently sitting on its hands.</p><ul><li><p><strong>The Glad Buyout Liquidity Crunch:</strong> On January 31, 2026, the joint venture with P&amp;G for <strong>Glad</strong> bags and wraps officially ends. Clorox is buying out P&amp;G’s <strong>20%</strong> stake at fair market value. This requires a significant cash outlay right when the company is already dealing with a negative equity position due to past share buybacks and a substantial debt load of over <strong>2.7 billion</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pricing Power Limits:</strong> In an inflationary environment where consumers are pinched, Clorox is finding it harder to pass on costs. If they push prices too high, they lose more share to generic brands. If they keep prices low, their margins (currently around <strong>41.7%</strong>) will continue to contract.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Dividend Ceiling:</strong> With a payout ratio near <strong>80%</strong>, the dividend is safe for now, but the days of meaningful <strong>5% to 7%</strong> annual raises are likely paused until the balance sheet is cleaned up.</p></li></ul><div><hr></div><h2>The Investing Plan: Buying the Blood</h2><p>Your long term goal here is to secure a high-quality income stream at a generational yield.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Margin of Safety:</strong> At <strong>98.00</strong>, the stock is trading at roughly <strong>16 times</strong> forward earnings, which is a steep discount to its 5-year average of <strong>23 times</strong>. With a <strong>5.05%</strong> dividend yield, you are getting a massive yield spread over the <strong>S&amp;P 500</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Accumulation Strategy:</strong> Buy 40% of the total desired position here at <strong>98.00</strong>. Save the next 30% for a “flush” toward <strong>92.00</strong>, which would represent a terminal valuation level. Keep the final 30% for when the stock moves back above <strong>108.00</strong>, confirming that the ERP transition is fully behind them.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Long Thesis:</strong> You are betting that the “household staple” status of brands like Hidden Valley and Burt’s Bees is temporarily obscured by a technical accounting shift (the ERP drawdown) rather than a permanent loss of brand power.</p></li></ul><div><hr></div><h2>The Trading Plan: The Tactical Bounce</h2><p>This is for the capital appreciation side of your brain, looking for a mean reversion.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Setup:</strong> Clorox is deeply oversold with an <strong>RSI</strong> hovering near <strong>36</strong>. It has formed a potential double bottom at the <strong>96.66</strong> level.</p></li><li><p><strong>Entry:</strong> Buy a starter trade position at <strong>98.20</strong> or on any dip toward <strong>97.00</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stop Loss:</strong> <strong>94.50</strong>. If the stock loses the <strong>95.00</strong> psychological support, the downward momentum is too strong to fight, and we exit to protect capital.</p></li><li><p><strong>Price Targets:</strong> The first target is <strong>104.50</strong>, which was the November breakdown point. The secondary target is <strong>109.00</strong>, where the 50-day moving average currently sits.</p></li></ul><div><hr></div><h2>Summary and Risk Reward Analysis</h2><p>The risk to reward ratio on the trading side is approximately <strong>3.5 to 1</strong>. You are risking about <strong>3.70</strong> per share to gain roughly <strong>11.00</strong> per share on a move back to the moving average.</p><p>From a fundamental “Margin of Safety” perspective, the Free Cash Flow (FCF) yield is currently sitting at a healthy <strong>5.4%</strong>. In the 2025 fiscal year, Clorox generated <strong>761 million</strong> in FCF, which is more than enough to cover the <strong>618 million</strong> in dividends paid. This suggests that while the earnings reports look messy, the actual “cash in the door” remains robust. The investment risk is not that the company goes bankrupt, but that it becomes a “dead money” asset for another 12 months as it fights for market share. However, for investors like us, getting paid <strong>5%</strong> annually to wait for a <strong>25%</strong> valuation recovery is a trade we take most days of the week.</p><div><hr></div><p>As I continue to refine my format for any due diligence on individual stocks, any comments are welcome!</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://mphinance.substack.com/p/post-holiday-deep-cleaning-with-clx/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://mphinance.substack.com/p/post-holiday-deep-cleaning-with-clx/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p></p>
