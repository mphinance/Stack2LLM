<p>🎲 $HAS Deep Dive: The “Two Companies” Thesis<br>Date: Nov 19, 2025<br>Price: ~$76.04<br>Verdict: Accumulate for the Long Term / Neutral Short Term</p><p>I’ve been tracking Hasbro for a while, and right now, this is the most complex setup in the consumer discretionary sector. Stop looking at this as a toy company. It’s effectively two different businesses trading under one ticker.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank"

It’s capital heavy, struggling with inventory, and shrinking (-7% revenue).</p></li><li><p>The Cash Cow (Wizards of the Coast): This is the future. High margin, recurring revenue, digital gaming.</p></li></ul><p>The market is pricing $HAS based on the struggling toy business, but the value is hiding in the gaming division. We are seeing an arbitrage opportunity where we can buy a premier digital gaming asset at a discount because it’s attached to a plastic toy manufacturer.</p><p>📊 Q3 2025: The Numbers You Need<br>The Q3 print was a classic “beat and raise” that the market shrugged off.</p><ul><li><p>Revenue: $1.39B (+8% YoY).</p></li><li><p>Magic: The Gathering: +55% Revenue Growth. (Let that sh*t sink in).</p></li><li><p>Op Margin: 25.6% (Excellent for this sector).</p></li></ul><p>Why the jump?<br>It’s all about Wizards of the Coast (WotC). While Mattel ($MAT) is down 6%, Hasbro is up because of digital and tabletop gaming. WotC margins hit 44%. That is software-level profitability.</p><p>The driver? “Universes Beyond.” They are integrating massive IPs like Marvel into the Magic ecosystem. The Spider-Man set was a monster hit, proving that the “Playing to Win” strategy by CEO Chris Cocks is working.</p><p>🧠 The “Mike” Factor: Why This Isn’t Just Toys<br>To understand why the gaming segment is crushing it, look at the demographics.</p><p>Take my friend Mike. He is 41, has a solid career, and is an avid Magic collector. Mike isn’t a kid asking his parents for $20 to buy a plastic figure at Walmart; he is an adult with disposable income dropping serious f*cking cash on premium collector boosters because it is his primary hobby.</p><p>This is the “kidult” shift. While the mass-market toy business fights for crumbs, the “Mikes” of the world provide a recession-resistant floor for the gaming division. For this demographic, Magic isn’t a discretionary purchase; it’s a lifestyle.</p><p>🚀 The Bull Case: 2026 Super-Cycle<br>The roadmap for the next 18 months is stacked. We aren’t just waiting for Christmas toy sales anymore; we are waiting for these IP drops:</p><ul><li><p>Final Fantasy (June 2025): Huge crossover with the gamer demographic.</p></li><li><p>Marvel Super Heroes (June 2026): Likely Avengers/X-Men. Could be the biggest revenue event in history.</p></li><li><p>The Hobbit (Aug 2026): Returning to the LOTR well that broke records in 2023.</p></li></ul><p>The Wildcard: Exodus<br>Hasbro is developing an internal AAA sci-fi RPG called Exodus (releases 2026). It stars Matthew McConaughey. The market is currently valuing this at $0. If this game is a hit, we get a massive repricing closer to a publisher like EA or Take-Two.</p><p>⚠️ The Bear Case: Risks &amp; Insider Signals<br>It isn’t all green candles. There are real risks here:</p><ul><li><p>Wallet Fatigue: They are pumping out so many new Magic sets that players might burn out. If the core community rebels, the cash cow dies.</p></li><li><p>Consumer Products: The legacy toy business is a drag. Revenue fell 7%. Kids are moving to screens earlier (the “KGOY” phenomenon).</p></li><li><p>Insider Selling: This is the biggest red flag. CEO Chris Cocks and other execs sold heavily in Q2/Q3. They are taking chips off the table while telling us the turnaround is working.</p></li></ul><p>📉 The Technicals: War on the Charts<br>Timeframe: Nov 2025<br>Price: ~$76.04</p><p>The chart reflects exactly what is happening fundamentally: a tug-of-war between the bullish gaming growth and the bearish toy decline. We are currently stuck in “no man’s land,” consolidating in a tight channel between $73 and $82.</p><p>The Pattern: Inverse Head and Shoulders<br>We are seeing a classic bullish reversal pattern forming on the weekly chart.</p><ul><li><p>Left Shoulder: ~$60</p></li><li><p>Head: $49 (The 2024 Low)</p></li><li><p>Right Shoulder: Where we are right now ($73-$76)</p></li><li><p>The Neckline: $82</p></li></ul><p>What this means: If we break above $82 with volume, the measured move targets $100+. Until then, it is choppy.</p><p>The Indicators (The “Engine Room”)</p><ul><li><p>50-Day MA ($76.41): We are wrestling with this level daily. It’s messy.</p></li><li><p>200-Day MA ($68.89): This is the “line in the sand.” As long as we stay above this, the long-term trend is bullish.</p></li><li><p>RSI (54): Neutral. Not overbought, not oversold.</p></li><li><p>MACD: Flashing a SELL signal. Momentum is currently bearish, so don’t chase green candles blindly.</p></li></ul><p>📝 My Trading Playbook<br>Since we are in the middle of the range, discipline is key. Here are my three scenarios.</p><p>Scenario A: The “Neckline Break” (Bullish)</p><ul><li><p>Trigger: Daily close above $82.20 on high volume.</p></li><li><p>The Play: Buy Stop at $82.50.</p></li><li><p>Target: $86 first, then $92.</p></li><li><p>Stop Loss: Trailing at $79.50.</p></li></ul><p>Scenario B: The “Channel Support” (My Preferred Play)</p><ul><li><p>Trigger: Price dips to $73 - $74 and shows a reversal candle (Hammer/Doji).</p></li><li><p>The Play: Limit Buy at $73.50.</p></li><li><p>Rationale: Buying at support gives the best risk/reward ratio.</p></li><li><p>Target: Back to $78.</p></li></ul><p>Scenario C: The “Trend Failure” (The Hedge)</p><ul><li><p>Trigger: Daily close below $68.50 (breaking the 200-day MA).</p></li><li><p>The Play: Short or Puts.</p></li><li><p>Target: $60.</p></li></ul><p>🏁 Final Verdict: Buy the Transformation<br>Hasbro is finally getting its sh*t together. It is trying to stop being a 20th-century factory and start being a 21st-century digital IP powerhouse.</p><p>The 55% growth in Magic revenue proves the strategy works. The market is scared of the toy decline and insider selling, but that fear is giving us a discount.</p><p>The Bottom Line:<br>At a P/E of 15x-18x with a 3.7% dividend yield, you are basically buying Wizards of the Coast at a discount and getting the toy business as a free call option on a turnaround.</p><ul><li><p>Investors: Accumulate in the $73-$75 zone. Collect the dividend while you wait for the re-rate.</p></li><li><p>Traders: Stay neutral until we hit $73 support or break $82 resistance.</p></li><li><p>Price Target (12 Months): $92.00</p></li></ul><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://mphinance.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Momentum Phinance is a reader-supported publication.
